<h1 style="background-color:#003b7f;color:#ffffff;padding:20px">Executive Summary</h1>

In today's competitive academic landscape, optimizing research efforts and ensuring the impact of scholarly work is crucial. However, a significant number of journal articles remain uncited and unnoticed, highlighting the need for a system to enhance research visibility and reach.

Our project aims to understand what makes a publication impactful and worthy of citation. By uncovering the factors that contribute to research impact, we can develop strategies to increase the visibility and recognition of scholarly articles.

We are driven by the need to address the challenges of research impact and bridge the gap between published research and its actual influence. Leveraging machine learning techniques and data analysis, we aim to develop a predictive model that can identify the factors influencing the citation and readership of scholarly articles. This model will help researchers and institutions prioritize their efforts by focusing on articles with a higher potential for citation and readership.

To achieve this, we are using the April 2023 Public Data File from Crossref, a comprehensive dataset containing scholarly metadata from various publications. This dataset provides standardized access to scholarly information for analysis and research purposes.

During the analysis, we compared the performance of three models: random forest, gradient boosting trees, and multilayer perceptrons. The gradient boosting trees model exhibited superior results, with a train accuracy of 84.92% and a test accuracy of 75.21%. This indicates the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data, instilling greater confidence in its predictions.

For researchers in stable fields, staying updated with emerging fields and exploring interdisciplinary collaborations can open new opportunities. Researchers seeking funding should encourage interdisciplinary collaborations, while those in the field of Data Science can leverage their expertise to contribute to the growing demand in the field.

In conclusion, our project addresses the challenges of research impact by developing a predictive model that identifies the factors influencing citation and readership. We provide valuable insights into the determinants of article impact, empowering researchers to make informed decisions about their publishing strategies. This leads to increased visibility, recognition, and wider dissemination of their work.

<h1 style="background-color:#003b7f;color:#ffffff;padding:20px">Motivation</h1>

In today's highly competitive and multidisciplinary [[5]](https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/1/2/730/96146/How-common-are-explicit-research-questions-in) academic landscape, where time and resources are scarce, it becomes crucial to optimize research efforts and ensure the impactful dissemination of scholarly work. Surprisingly, studies have shown that a significant portion of journal articles, approximately 90% [[1]](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2014/04/23/academic-papers-citation-rates-remler/)[[2]](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/half-academic-studies-are-never-read-more-three-people-180950222/), remain uncited [[3]](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/04/19/study-examines-research-never-receives-citation), while around 50% go largely unnoticed by anyone beyond their authors and editors. This alarming trend highlights the need for a robust and efficient system to enhance the visibility and reach of research outputs.

The motivation behind our project lies in addressing these challenges and bridging the gap between the vast amount of published research and its actual impact.

By leveraging machine learning techniques and data analysis, we aim to develop a predictive model that can identify the factors influencing the citation [[4]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2158244019829575) and readership of scholarly articles. This model will help researchers and institutions prioritize their efforts by focusing on articles with a higher potential for citation and readership. By providing valuable insights into the determinants of article impact, we hope to empower researchers to make informed decisions about their publishing strategies, ultimately leading to increased visibility, recognition, and the wider dissemination of their work.

<h1 style="background-color:#003b7f;color:#ffffff;padding:20px">Assumptions and Design Constraints</h1>

<span style="color:#003b7f; font-size:18px"><i>Proportionality Assumption</i></span>
 - It is assumed that the proportionality of the target variable in the sampled data reflects the proportionality of the original data. This assumption allows for generalization of the model's performance on the entire dataset based on the sampled data.

 - <span style="color:#003b7f; font-size:18px"><i>Modularity</i></span>
- The machine learning pipeline is designed with modularity in mind. This allows for flexibility in modifying and reusing specific stages of the pipeline without running the entire pipeline repeatedly.

- <span style="color:#003b7f; font-size:18px"><i>Memory Efficiency</i></span>
- To mitigate potential memory errors, the pipeline is optimized to minimize unnecessary re-computation. By storing intermediate results in separate variables, such as the train_data and test_data, the pipeline can be executed without rerunning the entire process.

- <span style="color:#003b7f; font-size:18px"><i>Hyperparameter Tuning</i></span>
- Hyperparameter tuning is performed separately for each model. This approach promotes modularity and reduces the risk of memory errors by focusing on optimizing individual models rather than running all models as a single pipeline.

- <span style="color:#003b7f; font-size:18px"><i>Usable Features</i></span>
- Features are selected based on their relevance to the prediction task. The design ensures that each pillar is represented by at least two features, which helps capture the essence of each pillar in the analysis.

- <span style="color:#003b7f; font-size:18px"><i>Baseline Comparison</i></span>
- The proportional chance criterion (PCC) is established as a baseline to compare the model's performance. To consider the predictions as good, the accuracy of the model needs to exceed 1.25 times the PCC.

- <span style="color:#003b7f; font-size:18px"><i>Performance Evaluation</i></span>
- The performance of each model is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into the model's predictive capabilities and its ability to correctly classify instances.

- <span style="color:#003b7f; font-size:18px"><i>Feature Importance</i></span>
- For tree-based models (random forest and gradient boosting trees), the feature importance is extracted to identify the most influential features. This analysis helps understand the contribution of each feature towards the model's predictions.

- <span style="color:#003b7f; font-size:18px"><i>Neural Network Model</i></span>
- A multilayer perceptron (MLP) model with two hidden layers is employed. Hyperparameter tuning is performed by varying parameters such as maxIter and blockSize to optimize the model's performance.

- <span style="color:#003b7f; font-size:18px"><i>Interpretability</i></span>
- The weights of the MLP model are extracted to provide feature importance, allowing for interpretability of the model's predictions.

- <span style="color:#003b7f; font-size:18px"><i>Comparison with Existing Models</i></span>
- The performance of the MLP model is compared against the results obtained from the random forest and gradient boosting trees models. This comparison helps assess whether the MLP model provides better accuracy and predictive capabilities.

These assumptions and design constraints provide the foundation for developing and evaluating the machine learning models. They consider memory efficiency, modularity, feature relevance, interpretability, and performance evaluation to ensure accurate and efficient predictions based on the provided information.
